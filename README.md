# DubHacks2022_EarthboundCleaning
This repository contains all the files related to a 2022 hackathon team project. We began the development of a web app that would allow students to easily find volunteer opportunities related to environmental restoration. We used React as a framework, along with Amazon Firebase and some other external libraries.
